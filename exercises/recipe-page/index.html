        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup pistachio paste/butter</li>
            <li>1 to 1/2 cup shredded phyllo or kataifi, 
                cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>vegetable oil, for frying</li>
           <li> 2 to 3 cups milk chocolate, melted</li>
           <li> 1/4 cup white chocolate, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan to 350Â°F.</li>
            <li>Add the shredded phyllo in and fry until golden and crispy. 
            If frying another batch, use a slotted spoon to take out the fried
             phyllo.Transfer to a plate with a paper towel to 
             drain excess oil.</li>
           <li> If you are not frying another batch, 
            it'll be easier to set up a bowl with a strainer and pour 
            the pan over to let the oil drain and the 
            strainer catch the phyllo.</li>
           <li> Allow the fried phylloto cool down for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the pistachio paste to a mixing bowl
            along with the fried phyllo and mix together to combine.</li>
            <li>OPTIONAL: To the chocolate mold,
            add a light drizzle of white chocolate.</li>
            <li>Then add in about 1/4 cup or more of melted milk chocolate and
            shake it around to cover the bottom and sides completely.</li>
            <li>Pop in the fridge or freezer for 10 to 15 minutes until hard.
            Take the mold out and fill the chocolate mold with the pistachio and
            phyllo mixture almost all the way to the top.</li>
            <li>Cover the filling entirely with more melted chocolate and
             pop it back in the fridge or freezer for 10 to 15 minutes until 
             hard.</li>
            <li> Once set, pop out of the mold and enjoy!</li>

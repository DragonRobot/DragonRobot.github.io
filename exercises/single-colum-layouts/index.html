                I was amazed by the final product!
                “I was amazed at the final product. I was nervous while waiting for it to arrive and I was so pleased with it when I was able to look at it. I will definitely use your service again and will reorder the book I made multiple times as more grandchildren get married.”

                Not a dry eye in the place!!!!
                “I put together all of my recipes that my daughter grew up with, added her engagement photos and presented it to her at her wedding shower. Not a dry eye in the place!!!! I was concerned about receiving the cookbook before my flight to the shower, so I contacted customer service. They replied quickly and within 24 hours my cookbook was shipped.”

                We got an excellent response!
                “I absolutely loved doing our cookbook on your site. It was so easy. We also got excellent response and feedback from the folks who bought one. At this point, we are not ordering more for the fundraiser, but I will be doing a few bigger, snazzier books for each of my nieces.”

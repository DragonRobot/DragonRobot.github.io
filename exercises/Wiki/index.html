            <b>Crown shyness</b> (alos <i>canopy disengagement</i>
            <sup>[1]</sub> <i>canopy shyness</i>,<sub>[2]</sub> or
            <i>Iner-crown spacing</i><sub>[3]</sub>) is a phenomenon 
            observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of 
            fully stocked trees do not touch each other, 
            forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.<sub>[4][5]</sub>
            The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species
            , but also occurs between trees of different species.
            <sub>[6][7]</sub>There exist many hypotheses 
            as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, 
            and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of 
            leaf-eating insect larvae.<sub>[8]</sub>

            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.
            <sub>[6]</sub>The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific 
            literature since the 1920s.<sub>[9]</sub> The variety of 
            hypotheses and experimental esults might suggest that there are 
            multiple mechanisms acrossdifferent species, an example of 
            convergent evolution.

            Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of 
            canopy branches leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees:
             trees in windy areas suffer physical damage as they 
             collide with each other during winds; the abrasions and 
             collisions induce a crown shyness response. 
             Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely 
             uninfluenced by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical 
             abrasion.<sub>[10]</sub> If the crowns are artificially
              prevented from
              colliding in the winds, they gradually fill the canopy gaps.
              <sub>[11]</sub> This explains instances of 
              crown shyness between branches
              of the same organism. Proponents of this idea cite that 
              shyness is particularly seen in conditions conducive to 
              this pruning, including windy forests, stands of 
              flexible trees, and early succession forests where branches 
              are flexible and limited in lateral movement.<sub>[6]</sub>
              <sub>[12]</sub>According to this theory, 
              variable flexibility in lateral branches
               greatly influences the degree of crown shyness.

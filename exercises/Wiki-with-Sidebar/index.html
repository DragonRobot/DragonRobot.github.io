                <p>
                    Mass Effect is a military science fiction media franchise
                    created by Casey Hudson. The franchise depicts a distant 
                    future where humanity and several alien civilizations have 
                    colonized the galaxy using technology left behind by 
                    advanced precursor civilizations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The franchise originated 
                    in a series of video games developed by BioWare and 
                    originally published by Microsoft Game Studios on the
                    first two games and its expansions. Later on, 
                    the series was taken over by Electronic Arts.
                    Each installment is a third-person shooter with 
                    role-playing elements. The first three games form a 
                    trilogy in which the player character, Commander Shepard,
                    attempts to save the Milky Way galaxy from a race of 
                    ancient, hibernating machines known as the Reapers. 
                    The inaugural video game in the series, Mass Effect (2007),
                    follows Shepard's investigation of Saren Arterius,
                    one of the Reapers' agents. Mass Effect 2 (2010)
                    begins two years later and sees Shepard's 
                    forces battling the Collectors, an alien race abducting 
                    human colonies to facilitate the Reapers' return.

                    The original trilogy's final installment, 
                    Mass Effect 3 (2012), depicts a war between the Reapers 
                    and the rest of the galaxy. A fourth game, 
                    Mass Effect:Andromeda (2017), featured a new setting 
                    and cast of characters, and a fifth is in active development.

                    The original trilogy was met with commercial success as well
                    as universal acclaim. Critics praised the game's narrative,
                    characters, voice acting, world building, and emphasis on
                    player choice. The ending of Mass Effect 3 drew widespread 
                    criticism for being an unsatisfyingconclusion to the trilogy
                    ,prompting Electronic Arts to release an expanded cut with 
                    additional cutscenes. Mass Effect: Andromeda received mixed
                    reviews. Praise was directed at the game's visuals and
                    combat, but the game drew criticism for technical issues
                    and its plot.

                    The series has generated attention and discussion about its representation of same-sex relationships and sexual minorities.[1][2][3] It also originated the dialogue wheel, a mechanic similar to dialogue trees, enabling players to dynamically steer conversations by selecting from a number of preset choices; the feature has seen widespread use in other role-playing video games. The success of the video game series spawned adaptations in other media, including novels, comics, and an animated film.

                <h1>Mass Effect</h1>
                <p>
                    Mass Effect is a military science fiction media franchise
                    created by Casey Hudson. The franchise depicts a distant 
                    future where humanity and several alien civilizations have 
                    colonized the galaxy using technology left behind by 
                    advanced precursor civilizations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The franchise originated 
                    in a series of video games developed by BioWare and 
                    originally published by Microsoft Game Studios on the
                    first two games and its expansions. Later on, 
                    the series was taken over by Electronic Arts.
                    Each installment is a third-person shooter with 
                    role-playing elements. The first three games form a 
                    trilogy in which the player character, Commander Shepard,
                    attempts to save the Milky Way galaxy from a race of 
                    ancient, hibernating machines known as the Reapers. 
                    The inaugural video game in the series, Mass Effect (2007),
                    follows Shepard's investigation of Saren Arterius,
                    one of the Reapers' agents. Mass Effect 2 (2010)
                    begins two years later and sees Shepard's 
                    forces battling the Collectors, an alien race abducting 
                    human colonies to facilitate the Reapers' return.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The original trilogy's final installment, 
                    Mass Effect 3 (2012), depicts a war between the Reapers 
                    and the rest of the galaxy. A fourth game, 
                    Mass Effect:Andromeda (2017), featured a new setting 
                    and cast of characters, and a fifth is in active development.
                </p>
                    The original trilogy was met with commercial success as well
                    as universal acclaim. Critics praised the game's narrative,
                    characters, voice acting, world building, and emphasis on
                    player choice. The ending of Mass Effect 3 drew widespread 
                    criticism for being an unsatisfyingconclusion to the trilogy
                    ,prompting Electronic Arts to release an expanded cut with 
                    additional cutscenes. Mass Effect: Andromeda received mixed
                    reviews. Praise was directed at the game's visuals and
                    combat, but the game drew criticism for technical issues
                    and its plot.

                    The series has generated attention and discussion about its
                    representation of same-sex relationships and sexual 
                    minorities.[1][2][3] It also originated the dialogue wheel,
                    a mechanic similar to dialogue trees, enabling players to 
                    dynamically steer conversations by selecting from a
                    number of preset choices; the feature has seen widespread
                    use in other role-playing video games.
                    The success of the video game series spawned adaptations
                    in other media, including novels, comics, and an animated 
                    film.

                    The Mass Effect original trilogy takes place in the
                    Milky Way towards the end of the 22nd century. In 2148, 
                    humanity discovered an alien outpost on Mars,
                    and learned that Charon is actually an alien artifact
                    known as a "mass relay" that enables faster-than-light
                    travel to other mass relays located across the galaxy.
                    These discoveries drastically increased the enhancement
                    rate of humanity's technology.

                    Humanity comes into contact with numerous other space-faring
                    alien species, some far more advanced than humans.
                    Humanity's first encounter resulted in the First 
                    Contact War, but the Council, a ruling body for the galaxy,
                    intervened to achieve peace and welcomed humanity.
                    The main species encountered by humanity include the asari,
                    a species of mono-gendered beings closely resembling human
                    women; the salarians, an amphibious species with
                    considerable technological and intellectual prowess and an
                    extremely high metabolism; and the turians, a heavily
                    militaristic race of raptor-like avian humanoids who fought
                    humanity in the First Contact War.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The center of the Council's governing power is the Citadel,
                    another artifact and a massive space station that, like the
                    mass relays, were made by a race known as the Protheans
                    believed to be the progenitor race for all species but long
                    since disappeared. Over the next few decades, humanity is 
                    given access to new technology, allowing them to colonize 
                    new planets, and they are made part of the Citadel Security 
                    (C-Sec) forces, a highly regarded position that other 
                    species had been long waiting for and take resentment over.
                    Numerous other inter-species conflicts remain active at the
                    time of the first game, results of past wars and conflicts
